A dog ran in the park. It was a big, fast dog. The dog chased a red ball. A girl saw the dog. She smiled and waved. The sun was warm. The park was green. She felt happy. The dog got the ball. It ran back to its owner. They played all afternoon. It was a very good day for the dog. The girl went home. She was tired and happy.
